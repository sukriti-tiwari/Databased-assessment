# Hello World! Thanks for exploring the opportunity to join us at DataBased.
# We wish you the best with the assessment.
# Please complete and come prepared to present your solutions to the team.

# Instructions: Solve the problems listed below.
# There are more details about the problems in the provided README, we highly
# recommend reading through the README before solving the problems.

# In order to run the program install Python if not already installed.
# Then change your current directory to the same as the file
# Run the command `python DataBased_Python_Assessment.py` or `python3 DataBased_Python_Assessment.py`
# If you see 'PASSED' that means you passed the all test cases in the test function,
# it does not mean your solution is 100% correct. There may be edge cases you
# should add tests for on your own!

# PROBLEM 1 - Least Factorial
# Given an integer n, find the minimal k such that
# k = m! (where m! = 1 * 2 * ... * m) for some integer m; k >=n. In other
# words, find the smallest factorial which is not less than n.

# PROBLEM 2 - Reclying Lipstick
# You own a lipstick business. When a lipstick container is empty, there is actu-
# ally some leftover lipstick at the bottom that cannot be used because it is not
# accessible. Being an environmentally friendly business owner, you would like to
# recycle the leftover lipstick to make more. As a business, you know you need
# 'numberOfLeftoversNeeded' to make a new lipstick. You have 'numberOfLip-
# sticks' in your possession. What's the total number of lipsticks you can sell
# assuming that each of your customers return their leftovers

# PROBLEM 3 - Students and Treats
# A school teacher wants to hand out treats to his students. The teacher de-
# cides the best way to divide the treats is to have the students sit in a circle of
# sequentially numbered chairs. A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Begin-
# ning with the student in drawn chair, one treat will be handed to each student
# sequentially going around the circle until all treats have been distributed.
# The teacher wants to have the students involved in sharing treats. He decides
# that whoever gets the very last treat, will be the student who makes the treats
# for the next game. Determine the chair number occupied by the student who
# will receive the last treat.

# For example, there are 4 students and 6 treats. The students arrange them-
# selves in seats numbered 1 to 4. Letâ€™s suppose 2 is drawn from the hat. Students
# receive treats at positions 2,3,4,1,2,3. The student who gets the last treat is in
# chair number 3
